/*Developers need to develop a tax calculator for calculating tax using
arithmetic, relational and logical operators.
Problem Statement 1: Declaring instance variables.
Develop a class “TaxCalculator” inside a package “com.cognizant.tax”. The class
should have an instance float variable named “basicSalary” and a boolean variable
named “citizenship”.
Problem Statement 2: Usage of Arithmetic operators.
In the TaxCalculator class create a method named calculateTax() that should
calculate and print the tax, the tax should be calculated as follows
tax = 30*basic salary/100
NOTE: The value stored in the instance variable” basicSalary” should be used in the
above calculation.
The calculated tax needs to be stored in another instance float variable “tax”.
This method will display the following message in the console.
“The Tax of the employee for the <basic Salary> is <tax>”*/
public class TaxCalculator{	
  float basicsalary;
	boolean citizenship;
	
	
	public float calculteTax(){
		float tax = 30*basicsalary/100;
		return tax;
	}

}

 class TaxCalculatorWork{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		

				TaxCalculator t = new TaxCalculator();

				t.basicsalary = 65000;

				System.out.println("the tax of the employee for the " + t.basicsalary + " is "
						+ t.calculteTax());

			}
		
	}
